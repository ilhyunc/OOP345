This project proved to be more challenging than OOP244. I had to consistently grasp and implement the concepts throughout the semester. 
There were moments when tackling a single function took several days, prompting me to dive into independent research and learning. 
Despite feeling disheartened at times for not cracking the code immediately, the sense of accomplishment upon finally solving it was immense. 
Throughout the project, I realized the importance of delving deeper into the STL library and felt the need to dedicate more time to studying it.
